# hello-world
My first repository
I am Paulina and I am a graduate of the Warsaw University of Technology in the field of Chemical Technology. Some time ago I started to be interested in programming and now I am trying to learn about it as much as possible. Who knows, maybe someday I will turn my laboratory into a desk with a laptop?
